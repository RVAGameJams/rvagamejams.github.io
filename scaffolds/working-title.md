Are you working on something you’re passionate about? **{Working Title}: Creative Coworking for Passion Projects** is a new biweekly event for getting stuff done in a relaxed group atmosphere with other creators. If you're tired of working alone, or want some inspiration from other folks, here is your chance!
<!-- more -->
The event runs from 6pm – 10pm and is broken into three parts:
– The main working phase where we'll get stuff done!
– A brief workshop phase where we can get unstuck from creative problems, or get feedback on ideas.
– A brief show & tell phase where we can show off what we've accomplished during the event!

The workshop and show & tell phases are totally optional.

Bring your tools (a laptop, art supplies, whatever you need to create!) Plenty of table space will be provided, but if you want to bring something particularly oversized, we ask that you check with us first.

Snacks will be provided, but we suggest making a $5 donation to keep the event running and help support RVA Game Jams!

All attendees must abide by RVA Game Jams safe spaces policy at all times.
