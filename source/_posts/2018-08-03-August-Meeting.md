We have our general meeting on the first Tuesday on each month, for playtesting each other's games, discussing game development, and occasional videos and workshops. All newcomers welcome!

This month we are focusing on open playtesting for anyone's games, including a new edutainment game by Deprecat Games, and maybe an appearance of ROOT 76's nearly finished multiplayer game!
