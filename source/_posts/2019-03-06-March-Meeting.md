Join us for our monthly meet-up, where we're running a playtest for **Loreweaver Creativeworks'** in-development turn-based strategy game, **War of Velana**! Join us in a discussion with the developer to provide feedback and learn more about how they made the game.

We will meet in the **basement Annex room**!
