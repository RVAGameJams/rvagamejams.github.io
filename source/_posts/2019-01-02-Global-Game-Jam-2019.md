RVA Game Jams is partnering with VCU Arts Department of Kinetic Imaging, VCU Libraries, and Champion Brewing to bring you this year's Global Game Jam â€“ a 48 hour, team-based game development event.

Join us starting on Friday, January 25th, at 6:00 pm at Champion Brewing where we'll kick off the event with a keynote talk and Q&A by **Clint "Halfcoordinated" Lexa**. Halfcoordinated is a specialized speedrunner, streamer, and accessibility advocate in games who advises game developers on how to include accessibility features, ensuring their games are able to be enjoyed by players in the disabled community.

On Saturday, January 26th, and Sunday, January 27th, we'll be hosting a dedicated development site and games showcase at **James Branch Cabell Library on VCU's Monroe Park Campus in the Multipurpose Room on the second floor**. We encourage all levels of experience and all skillsets to join us!
