Join RVA Game Jams for its general meeting the second Wednesday of each month. For May, we'll be hosting a **postmortem on Ludum Dare 44** – our most recent game jam from the end of April – where developers can show what they've made, what they learned, and get any feedback on their games. Come join us for a roundtable of game design discussion and playtesting feedback!

We will meet in the **basement Annex room**!
